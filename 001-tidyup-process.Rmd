# Tidyup 1: the tidyup proposal process

**Champion**: Hadley Wickham   
**Status**: Proposal

## Abstract

## Motivation

For bigger architectural changes, particularly those that span multiple packages or are likely to affect larger number of users, we need a process to clearly document the problem, possible solutions, our decisions, and to get feedback from the community.

## Solution

### Process

1.  Member of tidyverse team raises idea in weekly meeting.
    If no objections, begins to write up formal proposal.
    (Would consider how to invite community participation in the future).

2.  Write up .Rmd and submit to {SOME REPO}.
    Book discussion in tidyverse weekly meeting.

3.  Present to team, and collect discussion items.
    Update doc.

4.  Share with public via twitter and r-devel?.
    Where to discuss?
    Level of publicity to community would depend on specific case.

    1.  Not email. GitHub?

5.  What is the scope?

    1.  string sorting vec_order/arrange

    2.  dplyr + vctrs integration

    3.  tidyselect changes

    4.  annotations (strictness, laziness, types, ...)

    5.  case weights

    6.  colspec

    7.  Converting magrittr pipe to laziness

    8.  new packages that would perceived to be direct competitors to existing package (e.g. clock)

    9.  Only involve a single package

        1.  pivot_longer/pivot_wider

        2.  across --- also used in packages outside of the tidyverse

        3.  testthat 3rd edition

    10. Don't need widespread discussion, but we need to write up

        1.  name repair

        2.  tidyverse recycling rules

        3.  ellipsis, tidy dots, ...

        4.  R version support

### Document specification

Each tidyup should have the following parts/sections:

-   **Metadata**: short title, tidyup number, name of champion.

    -   Status can be one of draft, accepted, declined. Accepted = design is complete; final = implemented (i.e. code merged).

-   **Abstract**: short description of issue and proposed solution.
    Should allow the reader to determine if this is of interest to them and if they should keep reading.

-   **Motivation**: why does the change need to happen.

-   **Solution:** proposed solution(s).

-   **Reference implementation**: once status is accepted, link to PR.

-   **Rationale**: why was this solution picked?
    What other solutions were considered.

-   **Open issues**: while proposal is in process, record open issues that don't yet have solutions.

-   **Backwards compatibility**

-   **How to teach**
