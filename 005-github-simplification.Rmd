# Tidyup 5: Github simplification

Champion: Hadley Wickham\
Co-champion:\
Status: draft

## Abstract

## Motivation

Originally, we divided tidyverse and r-lib because we thought it was important to keep data science and package development tools separate.
Then when tidymodels kicked off, it seem natural for it to have its own home.

But there are some downsides to having multiple organisations for the tidyverse team:

-   While distinction between tidyverse, r-lib, and tidymodels is at reasonably strong in our heads, it's hard for users to articulate these differences, and to learn/remember exactly which organisation a package belongs to.
    This is particularly hard when you look holistically across RStudio.

-   There are a few packages that where it's less obvious which org they should belong too:

    -   rvest: is it programming or data science? what about httr?
    -   usethis: while it's technically programming, it's very user facing, and we expect data scientists might use it for analysis projects.
    -   glue: useful for data science but designed to be zero dep specifically for use by package developers.
    -   tibble/magrritr: both technically user-facing, but most people use via other packages
    -   modelr: we don't really want people to use this package.
    -   googledrive: not really about data analysis or package development.
    -   vroom is in r-lib, readr is in tidyverse.

    It often takes me multiple attempts to get to the correct URL for these packages.

-   It's painful to move issues across orgs.
    This affects packages like dplyr where the underlying issue might need to be fixed in vctrs.

-   As we start to use GitHub teams more, managing separate teams across separate orgs will become more painful.
    It also makes it hard to centralise discussions, and to explain succintly the scope of tidy ups.

## Solutions

There are three possible solutions:

-   Move all r-lib and tidymodels repos to **tidyverse org**.
-   Create a **new org** and move all r-lib, tidyverse, and tidymodel repos.
-   Move all r-lib, tidyverse, and tidymodel to the **rstudio org**.

These cases only affect the GitHub; all other websites would stay as is.

### Move to tidyverse org

Pros:

-   Moves smallest number of packages.
-   Tidyverse has strongest brand identity.

Cons:

-   Makes it more complicated to explain exactly what the tidyverse is. (It's a package; it's a set of packages loaded by `library(tidyverse)`; it's a set of packages installed by `install.packages("tidyverse")`; and it's a GitHub organisation).
-   No longer a one-to-one relationship between package homepage and GitHub organisation.
-   Lose ability to bury less-important packages in r-lib; harder to highlight most important packages in tidyverse.
-   Binds all packages more closely to tidyverse. This might be less appealing for external developers and for other RStudio teams we might hope would also migrate to one org.

### Create new org

Pros:

-   May be easier to persuade other organisations to join if not "tidyverse" branded.

Cons:

-   Will be hard to come up with good name.
-   In the short term, increases numbers of orgs.
-   Maximum number of packages need to be moved.

### Move to rstudio org

Pro:

-   Greatest reduction in packages.

-   Easy story to tell (now that RStudio is a PBC, we have 0% concerns about it as long term steward of this code).

Cons:

-   Eliminates veneer of separation between RStudio and tidyverse, and makes it harder to invite non-employee authors and maintainers.
-   Would fall under RStudio IT practices which are geared towards protecting private data.
-   Would need very clear reassurance that this isn't RStudio "muscling in" on open source. Regardless of how we communicate this, a few people are likely to generate negative press.

## Open questions

-   Are there any existing workflows that this would break?
