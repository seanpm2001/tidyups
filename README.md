# tidyups

This repo contains tidyups, proposals for changes to the tidyverse inspired by Python's [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)s.
These are used by the tidyverse team to propose and discuss changes that have significant crosspackage scope.
The tidyup process is a work in progress, but you can read the current outlined in [001-tidyup-process.md](001-tidyup-process.md).
It is currently designed to be as lightweight as possible so we can quickly iterate to figure out what is most useful.
